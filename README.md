# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

Here a small project (spent 3 hours only!) where I have classified e-mails according to their folders. 

Regretfully I can not share currently the data set. As soon as it will be availiable you can run the Jupyter notebook as usual. 

Anyway the current code maybe of any use for you. 

Best,
Zina
